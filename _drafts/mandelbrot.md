## Building a Mandelbrot generator in Haskell

For my course compilers (CS 4410) this year, we are writing a compiler in Standard ML, to which I've really enjoyed programming in.

Writing in this language had reminded me of last year, when I had taken Programming Languages (CS 4400) which was taught in Haskell. While I loved learning the language, I didn't have any free time at that period so I wasn't able to explore the language or create any personal projects to really get a grasp for it. 

Now that I have a little more free time in my schedule, I've decided to try and create some personal projects to explore it a bit more.
